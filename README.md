Created a static <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Tic%20Tac%20Toe%20Layout"><strong><em>Tic Tac Toe Layout</em></strong></a> using <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>.

><em>Okay, I know I said I had fun building the previous project, but this one... THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, I HAD FUN DOING. This could be an actual website all on its own! I felt really good completing this by just looking back at the finished product(Not the code, just how the finished product looked ^.^). But seriously, this one was fun to finish. </em>

><em>Working on the <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Startup%20Landing%20Page"><strong><em>Landing Page</em></strong></a> project gave me more practice working with the nav tag, nav classes which come with Bootstrap 3, icons, and the the ability to make web pages responsive according to screen size(phones, tablets, desktops). It also taught me how to make a background and image using background's URL() function in CSS and how to stretch the picture to take up the entire browser window and adjust accordingl. </em>

## Image Gallery w. Bootstrap 4

Created a responsive <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Image%20Gallery%20w.%20Bootstrap%204"><strong><em>Image Gallery</em></strong></a> using <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>Bootstrap 4</em>.

><em>This third iteration of <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Image%20Gallery%20w.%20Bootstrap%204"><strong><em>Image Gallery</em></strong></a> introduced me to Bootstrap 4 and its changes from Bootstrap 3. It also gave me more practice with the jumbotron class, Bootstrap buttons, and cards. My favorite part about this project was making the cards and giving each card a <span style="color: #e25555;">&hearts;</span> button. It reminded me of the like button on Instagram and it inspired me to continue on my Front End Developer journey!</em>

## Museum of Candy

Created a responsive Image Gallery named <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Museum%20of%20Candy"><strong><em>Museum of Candy</em></strong></a> using <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>Bootstrap 4</em>.

><em><a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Museum%20of%20Candy"><strong><em>Museum of Candy</em></strong></a> gave me a glimpse of jQuery which I used when I implemented the navbar's fade in when you leave the top of the page. This project was interesting because it taught me how you can change Bootstrap properties to make your page look like it wasn't built on bootstrap. This felt like an actual web page in the making. I want to continue learning so I can start implementing JavaScript into my codebase.</em>

## Incredibly Simple JavaScript Guessing Game

Created a <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Simple%20Guessing%20Game%20w.%20only%20JavaScript"><strong><em>Guessing Game</em></strong></a> using the very minimum of <em>HTML</em>, and <em>JavaScript</em>.

><em>In the <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Simple%20Guessing%20Game%20w.%20only%20JavaScript"><strong><em>Guessing Game</em></strong></a> project I learned the initial basics of JavaScript, and learned about the prompt(), alert(), and distinction between === and ==, which is that == prompts type coersion which changes the second comparing element into the same type as the first comparing element so that they can both be compared as under the same type. Now what === does is it compares the value and type of both elements without type coersion.</em>

## Score Keeper

Created a simple <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Score%20Keeper"><strong><em>Score Keeper</em></strong></a> using the very minimum of <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and mostly <em>JavaScript</em>.

><em>This one was more back-end-y, which I appreciate because I like back-end as much as front-end. I had an incredible time getting my hands dirty with more JavaScript. <a href="https://github.com/JuanJMendoza/MiniProjects/tree/master/Score%20Keeper"><strong><em>Score Keeper</em></strong></a> taught me about DOM manipulation and how to query elements by class name, id, or tag. This project made me feel really good about my progress and I can't wait to continue learning. I want to know it all!! xD</em>
